mymain01:
    Minimum bias ALICE definition charged particle multiplicity in central barrel (|eta|<1) (also used as input for multiplicity analysis - mymain11)

    mymain01Macro: rebinning and formatting for multiplicity analysis input and plotting
    TODO - mymain01Macro_mult_regions: show multiplicity distributions for different regions of detector.

mymain02:
    First attempt of HF->mu cross-section. DEPRECATED - should be removed.

mymain03:
    Second attempt of HF->mu cross-section. DEPRECATED - should be removed.

mymain04:
    Compare pT-hat cross-sections from Soft and Hard QCD, to identify where they converge for a specified energy.

    mymain04Macro: normalises and plots pT-hat for comparison of soft/hard QCD

mymain05:
    Repurposed to look at forward muon semileptonic contributions in minimum bias.

mymain06:
    Investigation of production mechanisms that lead to HF production - needs improvement (TODO)

mymain07:
    First attempt at running events in parallel. DEPRECATED - should be removed, as alternative method was found.

binned_mb_template:
    Pythia template to generate minimum bias events, using binned pT-hat generation. Can be copied and adjusted for specific generation.
