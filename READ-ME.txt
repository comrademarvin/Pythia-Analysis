mymain01:
    Minimum bias (MB) ALICE definition charged particle multiplicity in central barrel (|eta|<1) (also used as input for multiplicity analysis - mymain11)

    mymain01Macro: rebinning and formatting for multiplicity analysis input and plotting
    TODO - mymain01Macro_mult_regions: show multiplicity distributions for different regions of detector.

mymain02:
    First attempt of HF->mu cross-section. DEPRECATED - should be removed.

mymain03:
    Second attempt of HF->mu cross-section. DEPRECATED - should be removed.

mymain04:
    Compare pT-hat cross-sections from Soft and Hard QCD, to identify where they converge for a specified energy.

    mymain04Macro: normalises and plots pT-hat for comparison of soft/hard QCD

mymain05:
    Repurposed to look at forward muon semileptonic contributions in minimum bias.

    mymain05Macro: plots the total generated cross-section for MB and also the forward muon core contributions in MB.

mymain06:
    Investigation of production mechanisms that lead to HF production - needs improvement (TODO)

mymain07:
    First attempt at running events in parallel. DEPRECATED - should be removed, as alternative method was found.

mymain08:
    Third attempt of HF->mu cross-section. DEPRECATED - should be removed.

mymain09:
    Final version of HF->mu cross-section. Generated with pt-hat binning and outputs correct decay status. D/D0 mesons forced to decay into muons.
    TODO: include multiplicity

    mymain09Macro_compare_forced_decay:
        Final macro to compare HF->mu output from mymain09 to published data.

mymain09_HPC;
    Same as mymain09, but adjusted to run each pT-hat bin as a seperate job on the HPC cluster. Also generates events in parallel per bin job.
    Does not account for generated cross-section error - not implemented for pythia parallel.

    mymain09Macro_compare_forced_decay:
        Final macro to compare HF->mu output from mymain09_HPC to published data.
        Also ouputs standalone HF->mu hist as input for forward_muon_contributions_hist.
        Also outputs plot showing contributions from bins.

binned_mb_template:
    Pythia template to generate minimum bias events, using binned pT-hat generation. Can be copied and adjusted for specific generation.
